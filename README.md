# **Lung and Colon Tissue Classification with CNN**
### Overview: 
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify histopathological scans of lung and colon tissues into five categories:

* Lung Adenocarcinoma
* Lung Benign Tissue
* Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma
* Colon Benign Tissue
* Colon Adenocarcinoma

The goal is to accurately differentiate between tissue types using deep learning techniques, providing insights into automated diagnostic systems.

### Features
* Data Preprocessing: Organized and labeled histopathological image data for model training and testing.
* Model Architecture: Built a CNN with multiple convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.
* Performance Visualization: Plotted training and validation metrics (accuracy and loss) to evaluate the model.
* Confusion Matrix and Classification Report: Visualized model predictions and assessed performance on test data.

### Results
* Achieved **95% accuracy** on the test set.
